# GTFS_in_R

Repository for all the R scripts and apps related with GTFS data.

1- Costing by Zone: Hourly cost by of bus routes depending on the zone each of the stops is in. For this script to work a
GTFS and a file with the match stop-zone is needed. Contains the code for this article: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/costing-bus-operation-municipality-from-gtfs-r-toso/

2- Buses per hour: this markdown guides you on the process I followed to get the trips per hour on a given time window from a GTFS using R and how to make a nice graph showing that. You could change the time window to 15 minutes or whatever number you like. You can see the number of trips per time window at the stop level or the line level.

3- v4- Article - Trips per hour by line: This Markdown and Html have the code used to write my article on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/r-gtfs-getting-number-trips-per-hour-each-line-toso/.
